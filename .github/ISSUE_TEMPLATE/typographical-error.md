**Check whether the typo is in the latest build**
Go to build/gatm.pdf and see whether the typo is already fixed. If it's already fixed, no need to file an issue!

**Describe the typo**
Please tell us which section the typo is in, and what paragraph / sentence. The easiest way to do this is to put in the surrounding context:
```
Book:
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. The quick brown fx jumps over the lazy dog. Quisque vel eros ut nulla malesuada volutpat.
Specify:
... quick brown *fx* jumps over ...
```
