\noindent Thanks to \textbf{Josh Zucker} who wrote the first draft of several chapters (particularly The Geometry of Complex Numbers, Vitamin $i$, Matrix Multiplication, and Inverses part I).

Also, thanks to my fellow teachers at Gunn High School \textbf{Dave Deggeller} and \textbf{Danny Hahn} for resurrecting the use of this pamphlet in their 11\textsuperscript{th} grade Analysis classes and to their Analysis classes of 2013--14 who took on the project of retyping the text after the loss of the soft copy in a computer theft.

In addition, thanks to \textbf{Gautam Mittal} for editing the text for the 2017--18 academic year.

Above all, thanks to student assistants \textbf{Maya Sankar} (2014) and \textbf{Timothy Herchen} (2020) for their work on editing the text, typesetting the text in \LaTeX{}, and incorporating an answer key, and \textbf{Brandon Chung} and \textbf{Andrew Chang} for their additional help on the text, formatting, and cover.
