\section{Rotation and Reflection Groups}

\begin{outer_problem}
\item Notice that the original dihedral group had twice as many elements as the rotation group. Why?
\end{outer_problem}

(Answers may vary.)

There are a couple ways to think about this, but an intuitive way is to consider a ``mirror world'' of reflection and the ``normal world'' where the orientation in normal. Here, orientation is not absolute orientation, but the difference between clockwise and counterclockwise. For chemistry nerds, it is like chirality. Rotation preserves orientation, but reflection does not. Instead, it takes us between these two ``worlds.'' Thus, it allows twice the number of elements.

\begin{outer_problem}
\item Make and justify a conjecture extending this observation to the dihedral groups of other shapes like rectangles, squares, hexagons, cubes, etc.
\end{outer_problem}

(Answers may vary.)

Conjecture: The dihedral groups of a shape has twice the order of its rotation group.

Informal Justification: A shape can be flipped or not, and it can have whatever rotational isometries applied to it whether it's flipped or not. Thus, the dihedral group allows for twice the number of elements as the rotation group.

\begin{outer_problem}
\item Let $r$ be a $180^{\circ}$ rotation, $x$ be a reflection over the $x$-axis, and $y$ be a reflection over the $y$-axis. Write a table for the dihedral group of the rectangle, recalling that the allowed isometries are reflections and rotations. How does this table differ from the dihedral group of the equilateral triangle?
\end{outer_problem}

\begin{center}
$\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|}
\cdot & I & r & x & y \\ \hline
I & I & r & x & y \\ \hline
r & r & I & y & x \\ \hline
x & x & y & I & r \\ \hline
y & y & x & r & I \\ \hline
\end{array}$
\end{center}
The table is shown above. The four elements are shown acting on a rectangle with ``P'' painted on it in Figure~\ref{fig:p_rectangle} to show the transformation a bit better.

\begin{center}
\begin{asy}[width=0.4\textwidth]
path rect = (0,0)--(2,0)--(2,1)--(0,1)--cycle;

path P_outer = shift(1-0.35/2,0.5-0.5/2)*scale(0.1)*((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,2.5)--(2.5,2.5)..(3.5,3.75)..(2.5,5)--(0,5)--cycle);
path P_inner = shift(1-0.35/2,0.5-0.5/2)*scale(0.1)*((1,3.25)--(2,3.25)..(2.5,3.75)..(2,4.25)--(1,4.25)--cycle);

pair lp = (1,-0.5);

draw(rect);
filldraw(P_outer, gray(0.5));
filldraw(P_inner, white);
label("$I$", lp);

transform tr = shift(5,0)*scale(-1,1);

tr = shift(0,-1.5)*scale(1,-1);

draw(tr*rect);
filldraw(tr*P_outer, gray(0.5));
filldraw(tr*P_inner, white);
label("$x$", shift(0,-2.5)*lp);

draw((-0.3,-2)--(2.3,-2),dashed);

tr = shift(5,-1.5)*rotate(180);

draw(tr*rect);
filldraw(tr*P_outer, gray(0.5));
filldraw(tr*P_inner, white);
label("$r$", shift(3,-2.5)*lp);
\end{asy}

This differs from the dihedral group of the equilateral triangle, $D_3$, in several ways. The most obvious is that there are only $4$ elements. Also, all elements besides $I$ in this group have a period of $2$, while $D_3$ has two elements with a period of $3$.

\begin{outer_problem}
\item Write a table for the rotation group of the square, with $4$ elements and $16$ entries. Compare this table to problem 3.
\end{outer_problem}

The elements are $I=r_0$, $r=r_{90}$, $r^2=r_{180}$, and $r^3=r_{270}$. The table is shown below.
\begin{center}
$\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|}
\cdot & I & r & r^2 & r^3 \\ \hline
I & I & r & r^2 & r^3 \\ \hline
r & r & r^2 & r^3 & I \\ \hline
r^2 & r^2 & r^3 & I & r \\ \hline
r^3 & I & r & r^2 & r^3 \\ \hline
\end{array}$
\end{center}

While this has the same order as the rectangle's dihedral group, it has a different structure. There are two elements with period $4$ ($r$, $r^3$) and one element with period $2$ ($r^2$).

For each of the following problems, find the following:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Number of elements; this is known as the \textbf{order}
\item If order $< 10$, the set of elements; otherwise, an explanation of how you know the order
\item A smallest possible \textbf{generating set}; in other words, the list of elements which generate a group\footnote{There may be multiple generating sets of the same size.}
\item Whether the group is \textbf{commutative}; in other words, whether its operation $X\cdot Y$ doesn't care about the order of its operands ($X$ and $Y$)
\end{enumerate}

\begin{outer_problem}
\item Rectangle under rotation
\end{outer_problem}

\begin{inner_problem}[start=1]
\item Number of elements
\end{inner_problem}

This group has two elements, the identity and the rotation of $180^\circ$.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item If order $< 10$, the set of elements; otherwise, an explanation of how you know the order
\end{inner_problem}

As stated, they are the identity $I$ and the rotation $r$ of $180^\circ$, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rect_rot}.

\end{asy}
\captionof{figure}{Rectangle under rotation.}
\label{fig:rect_rot}
\end{center}

\begin{inner_problem}
\item A smallest possible \textbf{generating set}
\end{inner_problem}

The smallest possible generating set is the singleton $\{r\}$.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item Whether the group is \textbf{commutative}
\end{inner_problem}

The group is commutative, since it's only comprised of rotations, which commute.

\begin{outer_problem}
\item Rectangle under reflection
\end{outer_problem}

We already considered this in problem $3$.

\begin{inner_problem}[start=1]
\item Number of elements
\end{inner_problem}

There are $4$ elements in this group.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item If order $< 10$, the set of elements; otherwise, an explanation of how you know the order
\end{inner_problem}

The elements are the identity $I$, rotation $r$ by $180^\circ$, reflection $x$ over the $x$-axis, and reflection $y$ over the $y$-axis.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item A smallest possible \textbf{generating set}
\end{inner_problem}

(Answers may vary.)

$\{r,x\}$, $\{r,y\}$, and $\{x,y\}$ all generate the group. No single element, however, can generate the group.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item Whether the group is \textbf{commutative}
\end{inner_problem}

This group is commutative.

\begin{outer_problem}
\item Square under rotation
\end{outer_problem}

Again, we have considered this group before.

\begin{inner_problem}[start=1]
\item Number of elements
\end{inner_problem}

There are $4$ elements.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item If order $< 10$, the set of elements; otherwise, an explanation of how you know the order
\end{inner_problem}

The elements are rotations $I=r_0$, $r=r_{90}$, $r^2=r_{180}$, and $r^3=r_{270}$.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item A smallest possible \textbf{generating set}
\end{inner_problem}

(Answers may vary.)

Both $\{r\}$ and $\{r^3\}$ generate the group, because $1,3$ are coprime to $4$.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item Whether the group is \textbf{commutative}
\end{inner_problem}

The group is commutative, since it consists of all rotations.

\begin{outer_problem}
\item Square under reflection
\end{outer_problem}

\begin{inner_problem}[start=1]
\item Number of elements
\end{inner_problem}

There are $8$ elements in this group. We can quickly see this by noting that it is the dihedral group of the square, which has twice the order of the rotation group of the square. We just found that had $4$ elements, and $2\cdot 4=8$.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item If order $< 10$, the set of elements; otherwise, an explanation of how you know the order
\end{inner_problem}

The elements are as follows:

Rotations $I=r_0$, $r=r_{90}$, $r^2=r_{180}$, and $r^3=r_{270}$;
reflections $f=$ flip over the $x$-axis, $fr=r$ then $f$, $fr^2$ and $fr^3$.

Recall that rotations can be generated by a sequence of two reflections.

Each of these elements is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:square_reflect}.

\label{fig:square_reflect}
\end{center}

\begin{inner_problem}
\item A smallest possible \textbf{generating set}
\end{inner_problem}

(Answers may vary.)

Any pair of a rotation and flip will generate the set, except for $\{r^2,fr^2\}$ and $\{r^2,f\}$; these will produce the rectangle group instead. Any pair of two flips, except for $\{f,fr^2\}$, will also work. As an example of both of these categories, both $\{r^2,fr^3\}$ and $\{f,fr\}$ will generate the group.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item Whether the group is \textbf{commutative}
\end{inner_problem}

This group is not commutative. For example, $fr=fr$, but $rf=fr^3$.

\begin{outer_problem}
\item Square prism under rotation
\end{outer_problem}

This group is isomorphic to the dihedral group of the square in Problem 8.

\begin{inner_problem}[start=1]
\item Number of elements
\end{inner_problem}

This is a bit more difficult than the previous questions, because we need to understand what elements are possible. We can rotate the prism about its central axis, which an action analogous to just rotating a square: $4$ elements. But we can also rotate the prism $180^\circ$ on a axis through the middle (pictures are shown in the next subpart). This switches the top square face with the bottom face, giving another $4$ elements. In total, we have $8$ elements.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item If order $< 10$, the set of elements; otherwise, an explanation of how you know the order
\end{inner_problem}

The set of elements are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:this_took_me_so_long} below. Let $a$ be a rotation of $90^\circ$ counterclockwise---as viewed from the top---around the central axis, going through the centers of both square faces; let $b$ be a rotation of $180^\circ$ around an axis going through the centers of faces $\square ABB'A'$ and $\square DCC'D'$.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item A smallest possible \textbf{generating set}
\end{inner_problem}

(Answers may vary.)
The elements with $b$ in their name are equivalent to the reflections in the dihedral group of the square. Thus, we need a ``reflection'' $ba^n$ and a rotation $a^m$, or two separate reflections. All such pairs work except for $\{a^2,ba^2\}$, $\{a^2,b\}$ and $\{b,ba^2\}$. An example from each category: $\{a,b\}$, $\{b,ba\}$.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item Whether the group is \textbf{commutative}
\end{inner_problem}

This group is not commutative. For example, $ba=ba$, but $ab=ba^3$.

\begin{outer_problem}
\item Square prism under reflection
\end{outer_problem}

\begin{inner_problem}[start=1]
\item Number of elements
\end{inner_problem}

If the previous group---the rotation group of the square prism---had $8$ elements, then this group should have $16$ elements.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item If order $< 10$, the set of elements; otherwise, an explanation of how you know the order
\end{inner_problem}

We know the order because the previous group has $8$ elements, and dihedral groups have twice the number of elements of the rotation group, this group has $16$ elements.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item A smallest possible \textbf{generating set}
\end{inner_problem}

(Answers may vary significantly.)

Since we could generate the previous group with (most) pairs of $\{ba^n,a^m\}$, or (most) pairs of $\{a^n,a^m\}$, we could just add another element $c$ which is a true geometric reflection about, say, the midplane $P$ between $\square DCD'C'$ and $\square ABB'A$ as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:midplane_elem_c}.

Thus, $\{a,b,c\}$ can generate the group. You can prove that two generators are impossible, but the proof either requires making the group table or some more sophisticated abstract algebra. I will give the latter for those who are well-versed in group theory already, but it will probably be inaccessible to most.

\captionof{figure}{$d$ is the reflection through midplane $P$.}
\label{fig:midplane_elem_d}
\end{center}

The rotation group generated by $\{a,b\}$ is $D_4$. Define a new element $d$ which is the reflection through the midplane $P$ between the two square faces.\footnote{For the curious, $d=cba^2$.} This is crudely shown in Figure~\ref{fig:midplane_elem_d}; I couldn't be bothered to make a nicer figure. Then the reflection group generated by $\{d\}$ is $Z_2$. Furthermore, the operation sets $\{a,b\}$ and $\{d\}$ are separable, in that $a^xb^yd=da^xb^y\quad$\footnote{This can be shown concretely by simply showing geometrically that $ad=da$ and $bd=db$.}. Thus, the group $G$ described in this problem is (isomorphic to) the direct product:

$$G\cong D_4\times Z_2.$$

We wish to show that $Z_2\times Z_2\times Z_2$ is a quotient of this group. That is, we wish to find a normal subgroup $N$ such that

$$G/N = Z_2\times Z_2\times Z_2.$$

If this is true, then the minimal generating set of $G$ has at least cardinality $3$. All that remains is to find $N$ and $G/N$.

It suffices to show that $Z_2\times Z_2\triangleleft D_4$, since then $Z_2\times Z_2\times Z_2\triangleleft D_4\times Z_2.$ We have $|Z_2\times Z_2| = 2^2 = 4$, so we want $|D_4/N|=4$. We know $|D_4|=8$, so by Lagrange's theorem, $|N|=2$.

A normal subgroup of $D_4$ is $N=\{1,a^2\}$. It is normal because for $x\in\{0,1,2,3\}$ and $y\in\{0,1\}$:
\begin{align*}
(b^xa^y)a^2(b^xa^y)^{-1} &= (b^xa^y)a^2(a^{-y}b^{-x}) \\
&= b^xa^{2+y-y}b^{-x} \\
&= b^xa^2b^{-x} \\
&= b^xb^{-x}a^2 \\
&= a^2 \in \{1,a^2\}.
\end{align*}

The corresponding quotient group is

$$D_4/N = \{\{1,a^2\}, \{a,a^3\}, \{b,ba^2\}, \{ba, ba^3\}\}.$$

We have the isomorphism $\{b^xa^{y},b^xa^{y+2}\}\leftrightarrow (x,y)$ under the operation of element-wise addition modulo $2$. After all,

$$\{b^{x_1}a^{y_1},b^{x_1}a^{y_1+2}\}\cdot \{b^{x_2}a^{y_2},b^{x_1}a^{y_2+2}\} = \{b^{x_1+x_2}a^{y_1+y_2},b^{x_1+x_2}a^{y_1+y_2+2}\}.$$

Therefore, $$D_4/N \cong Z_2 \times Z_2,$$ so $$Z_2 \times Z_2 \times Z_2 \triangleleft D_4\times Z_2=G.$$ Since the minimal generating set of $Z_2\times Z_2\times Z_2$ is $3$, $G$'s generating set is at least $3$. But we've already found the set $\{a,b,c\}$ which generates $G$!\footnote{$\{a,b,d\}$ also generates $G$.} Thus, it is minimal.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item Whether the group is \textbf{commutative}
\end{inner_problem}

As we found in the previous problem, the rotation group of the square prism is not commutative, and since that's a subgroup of this group, this group certainly isn't commutative.

\begin{outer_problem}
\item Pentagon under rotation
\end{outer_problem}

\begin{inner_problem}[start=1]
\item Number of elements
\end{inner_problem}

This is just the cyclic group of order $5$, so there are $5$ elements.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item If order $< 10$, the set of elements; otherwise, an explanation of how you know the order
\end{inner_problem}

The elements are rotations of $I=r_0$, $r=r_{72}$, $r^2=r_{144}$, $r^3=r_{216}$, $r^4=r_{288}$. They are shown below.

\begin{center}
\begin{asy}[width=\textwidth]
void draw_pentagon(string[] labels, pair pos=(0,0)) {
	pair prev_pt;
	for (int i = 0; i < 6; ++i) {
		real ang = pi/2 + i * 2 * pi / 5;
		pair cist = (cos(ang),sin(ang));
		pair vertex = pos + (cos(ang),sin(ang));
		
		if (i != 0) {
			draw(vertex--prev_pt);
			label("$" + labels[i % 5] + "$", vertex, cist);
		}
		
		prev_pt = vertex;
	}
}

string[] vertices = {"A","B","C","D","E"};
string[] labels = {"I","r","r^2","r^3","r^4"};

real r = 0.5;

for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
	draw_pentagon(vertices, (3*i,0));
	label("$"+labels[i]+"$", (3*i,-1), S);
	
	real ang = i * 2 * pi / 5;
	
	if (i != 0) draw(shift(3*i,0)*((r,0)..r*(cos(ang/2),sin(ang/2))..r*(cos(ang),sin(ang))), Arrow);
	
	vertices.insert(0, vertices[4]);
	vertices.delete(5);
}
\end{asy}
\end{center}

Pentagons should always wear helmets, lest they want to damage their vertices.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item A smallest possible \textbf{generating set}
\end{inner_problem}

Any rotation by itself $\{r^n\}$ works, since $5$ is a prime.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item Whether the group is \textbf{commutative}
\end{inner_problem}

The group is indeed commutative, since all operations are rotations.

\begin{outer_problem}
\item Pentagon under reflection
\end{outer_problem}

\begin{inner_problem}[start=1]
\item Number of elements
\end{inner_problem}

This is the dihedral group of the pentagon, which has $2\cdots 5=10$ elements.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item If order $< 10$, the set of elements; otherwise, an explanation of how you know the order
\end{inner_problem}

We know the order because it should have twice the number of elements as the rotation group, which has $5$ elements, giving $10$ elements total.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item A smallest possible \textbf{generating set}
\end{inner_problem}

We can either do a rotation and a reflection or two reflections. Since $5$ is prime, all pairs work (unlike for the square). Let $f$ is a flip over the vertical axis. Examples of each are $\{r,f\}$ and $\{f,fr\}$.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item Whether the group is \textbf{commutative}
\end{inner_problem}

The group is not commutative. For example, $fr=fr$, but $rf=fr^4$.

\begin{outer_problem}
\item Pentagonal prism under rotation
\end{outer_problem}

This is isomorphic to the dihedral group of the pentagon, which is Problem 12. The reason is the same as for Problem 9's dependence on 8, thus I will not explain it.

\begin{outer_problem}
\item Pentagonal prism under reflection
\end{outer_problem}

This is akin to Problem 10.

\begin{inner_problem}[start=1]
\item Number of elements
\end{inner_problem}

$2\cdot 10=20.$

\begin{inner_problem}
\item If order $< 10$, the set of elements; otherwise, an explanation of how you know the order
\end{inner_problem}

We know the order because the rotation group of the pentagonal prism has $10$ elements, so its dihedral group has $20$ elements.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item A smallest possible \textbf{generating set}
\end{inner_problem}

If $a$ is a rotation of $72^\circ$ about the central axis, $b$ is a rotation of $180^\circ$ about a horizontal axis, and $d$ is a reflection across the midplane between the two pentagonal faces, then $\{a,b,d\}$ generates the set, since $\{a,b\}$ generates all rotations and $d$ turns them into their mirror images. But this isn't the right answer.

Are there any smaller generating sets? The previous trick asserting no using more advanced abstract algebra doesn't actually work\footnote{If you understand it, it's because $Z_2\times Z_2\times Z_2$ isn't a quotient of this group, since this group $D_5 \times Z_2$ has order $20$ which is not divisible by $8$.}. Well, since $ad=da$ and $bd=db$ (you can verify this geometrically). So to have a two element subgroup we likely need something like $a^nd$ and $ba^m$ for some integers $n,m$.

Let's try $ad$ and $b$. Taking successive powers of $ad$, we get

\begin{align*}
ad &= ad \\
(ad)^2 &= a^2 \\
(ad)^3 &= a^3d \\
(ad)^4 &= a^4 \\
(ad)^5 &= a^5d = d \\
(ad)^6 &= a \\
\end{align*}

We've just generated $d$ and $a$ from $ad$ alone! Since we have $b$ already, we have created $\{a,b,d\}$ from $\{ad,b\}$. Thus, the smallest generating set has size $2$. (We can't have size $1$ because then the group would be cyclic and thus commutative, which this group certainly isn't.)

This is a hard problem. Don't worry if you didn't get it.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item Whether the group is \textbf{commutative}
\end{inner_problem}

The dihedral group of the pentagon is a subgroup of this group, and is not commutative, so this group is not commutative.

\begin{outer_problem}
\item Pentagonal pyramid under rotation
\end{outer_problem}

This is just isomorphic to the rotation group of the pentagon, or Problem 11.

\begin{outer_problem}
\item Pentagonal pyramid under reflection
\end{outer_problem}

This is just isomorphic to the reflection group of the pentagon, or Problem 12.

\begin{outer_problem}
\item Tetrahedron (triangular pyramid) under rotation
\end{outer_problem}

This is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_4$, the snap group of order $24$.

\begin{inner_problem}[start=1]
\item Number of elements
\end{inner_problem}

The snap group includes reflections, but this does not: thus, this group has $\frac{4!}{2}=12$ elements.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item If order $< 10$, the set of elements; otherwise, an explanation of how you know the order
\end{inner_problem}

We know the order because this is the rotation group of a tetrahedron, and the reflection group of a tetrahedron has $24$ elements, so this must have half that.

\begin{inner_problem}
\item A smallest possible \textbf{generating set}
\end{inner_problem}

Another difficult problem!

Let's figure out where the rotation axes actually are. There are $4$ axes going through a vertex---let's call these \textit{vertex} rotations. There are also $3$ axes going through the centers of opposite edges: let's call these \textit{edge} rotations.

One element is clearly not enough, because this group is not cyclic.
